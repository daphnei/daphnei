I am a final-year PhD student at University of Pennsylvania and a [research scientist](https://research.google/people/DaphneIppolito/) at Google.
I am interested in the properties of generative language models for text and the challenges of automatically generating narratives that are simultaneously coherent and interesting.
I also look at ways to allow human writers to use generative text models as creative tools.
My PhD is co-advised by Professor [Chris Callison-Burch](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/) at UPenn and Principal Scientist [Douglas Eck](https://research.google/people/author39086/) at Google Brain.
In my spare time, I like to [garden](https://photos.app.goo.gl/yfgLmS4jgf3VSGH98), and I play flute in UPenn's [Baroque music ensembles](https://music.sas.upenn.edu/ensembles/baroque-and-recorder-ensembles).
